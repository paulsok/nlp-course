        "\n",
        "__A. Toxicity fine-tuning:__ train the model to be less (or more!) toxic. For this task, you may use the data from [jigsaw toxic comments](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) and [lmsys/toxic-chat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/toxic-chat),  or any other source.

        "__C. Controlled generation:__ Instead of training a reward model from human feedback, you may define the reward function as the text length (longer or shorter) or number of times the model uses specific words (e.g. \"sorry\", \"apologize\"). If you choose specific words, make sure the model generates them at least sometimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Alternatively,__ you may choose a different task. However, unless your task is very similar to one of the above, there is a chance that it will be **significantly** harder to solve, requiring orders of magnitude more compute and tuning. If you are in doubt, please ask the course staff. If they are AFK (again >.<), please prefer one of the recommended tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "We highly recommend that you manually check the performance after each sub-stage:\n",
        "1. when you assembled the pairwise dataset, inspect a couple of from of *your* dataset class and detokenize them. Make sure that you-the-human understand why one sample was accepted and the other - rejected. At least most of the time. This also lets you spot tokenization/truncation errors.\n",
        "2. after you trained a reward model, measure how accurate this model is in isolation. If your reward model is poor, any subsequent RLHF will also fail.\n",
        "3. once you've trained the main model with RL, ask it to generate examples and explore how well it does. If it produces an obviously bad output, check if the reward model assigns high reward to that output. If yes, reward model is the culprit; if no, it's a question of better/longer PPO training.\n",
        "\n",
        "__It is also a good idea to periodically print samples during training.__\n",
        "\n",
        "__When stuck, simplify the problem.__ If you've spent a several hours enchanting the reward model but it still won't budge, try switching to a simple subtask. For instance, if you're training on hh-rlhf, try limiting it the dataset to 10% of the shortest sequences - they are typically easier to learn.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "__Not all tasks require a reward model for later PPO fine-tuning.__ For instance, there's no reason to train a reward model if your reward equals sentence length. Likewise, toxicity reward can be estimated with a pre-trained toxicity classifier. __If your task does not require training a reward model, please train an unrelated model on [hh-rlhf](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf) as though you were solving assignment version B.__ This is for grading purposes only, you won't use this model for stage 2.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "First, you need to choose a language model to be fine-tuned. You may choose any model, but make sure that your model **can** generate the data in your format. For instance, [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) is a general purpose LM and may (or may not) need prompt engineering to generate chat assistant responses. For that reason, it is best if you **do not use `\"lvwerra/gpt2-imdb\"` unless you're generating only movie reviews**.\n",

        "If you want the **Hard mode:** use a larger (e.g. 7B) model in combination with `load_in_4bit` and LoRA, the same way we did last week.\n",
        "Some reasonable model choices are [LLaMA-7B](https://huggingface.co/Enoch/llama-7b-hf), [Falcon-7b](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b), [Mistral-7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) for general-purpose LM or [guanaco-7b](https://huggingface.co/timdettmers/guanaco-7b), [vicuna-7b](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5) for chat-based tasks, though there are many more (see [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)). In the hard mode, you will need to modify the training arguments to enable 4-bit fine-tuning. Furthermore, your experiments will take somewhat longer to complete. On the plus side, your model will produce significantly better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "__High reward is not enough!__ RL algorithms are famous for [cheating their reward functions](https://openai.com/research/faulty-reward-functions). To ensure that your model is actually doing what you want it to do, you will need some additional evaluation. To get the full grade, provide at least 20 side-by-side examples of your fine-tuned model vs original model predictions and a short summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, you may provide 5 examples and some extrinsic evaluation metric over many examples. For instance, you may use a different pre-trained toxicity score for option A. When dealing with human preferences, you may choose to [enlist actual humans](https://toloka.ai/) or [ask GPT4/Claude](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03277.pdf) to compare your model's predictions.
